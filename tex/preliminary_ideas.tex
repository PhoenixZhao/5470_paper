\section{Preliminary ideas}
Apart from the existing work considering trust or social connections as side information to improve the performance of RS, I will dive deeper into utilizing the trust information based on an intuition that we trust different friends in different domains. For example, we usually seek for advices on movies and cars recommendation from different friends just depending on how much we trust them in the corresponding domain. Therefore, it's not that accurate for the previous work, which directly considers the trust in the whole.

Another idea comes from a fact that previous work rely on explicit trust claimed in the dataset like Epinion\footnote{http://www.public.asu.edu/~jtang20/datasetcode/truststudy.htm} while in most online social networks, the explicit trust are not accessible. This leads to an very straightforward concern on inferring implicit trust according to users' social connections and behaviors history.Therefore, new methods will be proposed to model the implicit trust.

In summary, I will continue working on integrating trust into existing MF framework for RS. However, my focus will be on domain-specific and implicit trust, which will surely be novel to previous work.
